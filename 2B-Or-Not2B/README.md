## üé® Customization Guide

### Text Elements
- **Main Text**: "[ 2b | !2b ]" - The core programming joke

Each text element has independent color control, allowing you to:
- Match your system theme

- Express your personal style
- Adapt to different lighting conditions

### Font Size Options
- **Main Text**: 8px to 128px - Make it subtle or bold
- **Subtitle**: 6px to 64px - Fine-tune the supporting text

## ü§ù Editing

Again, if it's on my github, it's because you are free to take it, edit it, break it and fix it, the point is that feel free to learn from it and open a pull request that I'll never see because too lazy to read and approve
