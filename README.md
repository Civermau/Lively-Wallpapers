## 🎨 About This Collection

I've always loved the customization, creating grub themes for linux, playing with linux plymouth boot animations, trying to create wallpapers, playing with window's customization like cursors, icons for apps and folders, sounds...

And now I'm trying to create interactive live wallpapers too using lively wallpaper!
A pretty cool tool that I discovered a while ago and now I wanted to create my very own wallpapers (Even if everyone just uses wallpaper engine, I don't have money, ok?)

So yeah, feel free to check them out, fork them and learn from them to make your owns!
